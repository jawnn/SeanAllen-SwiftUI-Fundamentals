//MARK: Project log
// 9/20/2023
// Build weather app UI, bare minimum approach. Learned about Z,V,H Stacks, Text, Button, Image. Use modifiers for each object to adjust UI properties. SwiftUI can only hold 10 views, best way to combat is to refactor.

// 9/22/2023
// Refactor weather app UI components to separate structs. Create files for common reusable components of app. Keep unique views to screen on file.
// Learning about @State and @Binding variables. Introduction to passing data around in SwiftUI
// Create data model to refactor DayWeatherView
